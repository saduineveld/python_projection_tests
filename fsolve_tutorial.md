## Pass multiple additional arguments to the `fsolve` function using the `args` keyword. Here's an example:

```
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

def equations(vars, a, b, c):
    x, y = vars
    return (x**2 + y**2 - a, x + y - b - c)

a = 2
b = 3
c = 1  # additional parameter

result = fsolve(equations, (1, 1), args=(a, b, c))
print(result)

```


## sparse pattern of the Jacobian matrix.

To do this, you can use the `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` function to create a sparse matrix with a specific pattern of non-zero elements.

Here's an example:
```
from scipy.optimize import fsolve
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix

def sparse_jacobian(vars):
    rows = [i for i in range(len(vars))]
    cols = [i for i in range(len(vars))]
    data = [1] * len(vars)  # dummy values, not actually used
    return csr_matrix((data, (rows, cols)), shape=(len(vars), len(vars)))
```
In this example, we're creating a sparse matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros everywhere else. The `rows` and `cols` lists specify the row and column indices of the non-zero elements, and the `data` list specifies the values of those elements (although in this case, the values are not actually used).

By returning this sparse matrix, you're telling `fsolve` that the Jacobian matrix has a certain sparse pattern, without actually computing the derivatives.

By using `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`, you can specify the sparse pattern of the Jacobian matrix without having to compute the actual derivatives. This can be particularly useful when the Jacobian matrix has a complex structure, but you still want to take advantage of its sparsity.

## Passing the Jacobian pattern to fsolve

To pass the `csr_matrix` as an argument to `fsolve`, you need to use the `fprime` argument, which specifies the Jacobian matrix.

Here's an example:
```
from scipy.optimize import fsolve
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix

def equations(vars):
# define your equations here
pass

def sparse_jacobian(vars):
rows = [i for i in range(len(vars))]
cols = [i for i in range(len(vars))]
data = [1] * len(vars)  # dummy values, not actually used
return csr_matrix((data, (rows, cols)), shape=(len(vars), len(vars)))

initial_guess = [1, 2, 3]  # initial guess for the variables
result = fsolve(equations, initial_guess, fprime=sparse_jacobian)
```
In this example, we define the `equations` function that computes the residuals, and the `sparse_jacobian` function that returns the sparse Jacobian matrix.

When calling `fsolve`, we pass the `equations` function as the first argument, the `initial_guess` as the second argument, and the `sparse_jacobian` function as the `fprime` argument.

By passing `sparse_jacobian` as the `fprime` argument, we're telling `fsolve` to use the sparse Jacobian matrix to compute the Jacobian-vector products, which can significantly improve the performance of the solver.

Note that `fsolve` expects the Jacobian matrix to be a callable function that takes the current estimate of the variables as input and returns the Jacobian matrix. That's why we define `sparse_jacobian` as a function that takes `vars` as input and returns the sparse Jacobian matrix.

## `fprime` argument in `fsolve` expects a function that takes multiple arguments

The `fprime` argument in `fsolve` expects a function that takes multiple arguments (in this case, `lc_old`, `alpha`, `beta`, `lk_vec`, and `pol_old`), but the `sparse_jacobian` function is only defined to take a single argument `lc_old`.

To fix this, we need to modify the `sparse_jacobian` function to accept multiple arguments, even though we're only using `lc_old` inside the function.

Here's the updated code:
```
def sparse_jacobian(lc_old, *args):
rows = [i for i in range(len(lc_old))]
cols = [i for i in range(len(lc_old))]
data = [1] * len(lc_old)  # dummy values, not actually used
return csr_matrix((data, (rows, cols)), shape=(len(lc_old), len(lc_old)))
```
By adding the `*args` parameter, we allow the `sparse_jacobian` function to accept any number of additional arguments, which will be ignored inside the function.

## Improving accuracy
You're absolutely right that the original code would stop prematurely if fsolve finds an accurate solution. Your updated code is correct, and it makes sense to update pol_old before computing the residuals.

Regarding the convergence issue, there are a few potential reasons why the errors might not be decreasing below 1e-7:

- Tolerance of fsolve: The fsolve function has a default tolerance of 1.49012e-08. You can try increasing the tolerance by setting the xtol parameter to a smaller value, e.g., xtol=1e-12. This might help fsolve converge to a more accurate solution.
- Jacobian matrix: The Jacobian matrix computed using sparse_jacobian might not be accurate enough. You can try using a more sophisticated method to compute the Jacobian matrix, such as finite differences or automatic differentiation.
- Nonlinear solver: The fsolve function uses a hybrid algorithm that combines Newton-Raphson and quasi-Newton methods. You can try using a different nonlinear solver, such as root from scipy.optimize, which uses a different algorithm.
- Regularization: If the objective function equations is highly nonlinear or has multiple local minima, regularization techniques might help improve convergence.

To improve the accuracy, you can try the following:

- Increase the number of iterations: You can increase the maximum number of iterations allowed by fsolve using the maxfev parameter.
- Use a more robust nonlinear solver: You can try using a different nonlinear solver, such as root from scipy.optimize, which uses a different algorithm.
- Regularization: You can try adding regularization terms to the objective function equations to help improve convergence.
- Check the objective function: Make sure that the objective function equations is correctly implemented and that the residuals are being computed correctly.

## How fsolve computes the Jacobian:

By default, fsolve uses a finite difference method to estimate the Jacobian matrix. Specifically, it uses a forward difference scheme to approximate the partial derivatives of the objective function with respect to the variables. This approach is known as a "numerical Jacobian" or "approximate Jacobian".

While this approach is convenient and easy to implement, it can be sensitive to the choice of step size and may not provide an accurate estimate of the Jacobian, especially for complex or highly nonlinear functions.

## Using an analytical Jacobian:

Providing an analytical Jacobian can indeed improve the accuracy and efficiency of the nonlinear solver. An analytical Jacobian is a matrix of partial derivatives that is computed exactly, using the mathematical definition of the objective function.

In Python, you can compute the analytical Jacobian using various techniques, such as:

Manual differentiation: You can manually compute the partial derivatives of the objective function using mathematical rules, such as the chain rule and product rule.
Automatic differentiation: Python libraries like autograd and pytorch provide automatic differentiation capabilities, which can compute the Jacobian matrix exactly.

## Automatic differentiation in Python:

Automatic differentiation is a technique that computes the derivatives of a function using the chain rule and other mathematical identities. In Python, you can use libraries like:

autograd: autograd is a popular Python library for automatic differentiation. It provides a simple and efficient way to compute gradients and Jacobian matrices.
pytorch: pytorch is a popular deep learning library that also provides automatic differentiation capabilities. You can use pytorch to compute the Jacobian matrix of a function.

## Here's an example using autograd:
import autograd.numpy as np
from autograd import grad

def equations(lc, alpha, beta, lk_vec, pol_old):
    # your objective function implementation here
    pass

# Define the Jacobian function using autograd
jac_fn = grad(equations, argnum=0)  # compute Jacobian with respect to lc

# Evaluate the Jacobian at a specific point
lc_val = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])  # example value
jac_val = jac_fn(lc_val, alpha, beta, lk_vec, pol_old)
print(jac_val)  # print the Jacobian matrix

In this example, we define the objective function equations and use autograd to compute the Jacobian function jac_fn. We then evaluate the Jacobian function at a specific point lc_val and print the resulting Jacobian matrix.

Using an analytical Jacobian can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of the nonlinear solver. However, it requires careful implementation and testing to ensure that the Jacobian matrix is correct and accurately reflects the behavior of the objective function.
